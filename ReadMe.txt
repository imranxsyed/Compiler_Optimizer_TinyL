A Compiler and Optimizer for tinyL
Due date: Monday, October 23, 11:59pm
THIS IS NOT A GROUP PROJECT! You may talk about the project and possible
solutions in general terms, but must not share code. In this project, you will be asked to
write a recursive descent LL(1) parser and code generator for the tinyL language as discussed
in class. Your compiler will generate RISC machine instructions called ILOC (Intermediate
Language for Optimizing Compilers). You will also write a code optimizer that takes ILOC
instructions as input and implements different peephole optimizations. The output of the
optimzer is a sequence of ILOC instructions which produces the same results as the original
input sequence. To test your generated programs, you can use a virtual machine (simulator)
that can ‚Äúrun‚Äù your ILOC programs. The project will require you to manipulate linked
lists of instructions. In order to avoid memory leaks, explicit deallocation of ‚Äúeliminated‚Äù
instructions is necessary.
This document is not a complete specification of the project. You will encounter important
design and implementation issues that need to be addressed in your project solution.
Identifying these issues is part of the project. As a result, you need to start early,
allowing time for possible revisions of your solution.

1 Background
1.1 The tinyL language
tinyL is a simple expression language that allows assignments, and print as its only I/O
operation. Every token is a single character of the input. This makes scanning rather easy,
but does not allow integer constants of more than one digit, or variable names of more than
one character. The language specification in Backus-Naur from is given in Figure . The
following are examples of two valid tinyL programs:
(1) a=3;b=5;c=/3*ab;d=+c1;!d.
(2) a=7;b=-*+1+2a58;!b.

The target architecture is a RISC machine with 4096 registers. All registers can only
store integer values. A RISC architecture is a load/store architecture where arithmetic
instructions operate on registers rather than memory operands (memory addresses). This
means that for each access to a memory location, a load or store instruction has to be
generated. Here is the machine instruction set of our RISC target architecture. You are only
allowed to use these ILOC instructions. ILOC instructions are case sensitive. rx, ry, and
rzrepresent three registers.

1.3 Code Shape
Your compiler should generate code of a specific form with respect to how variables are
accessed. All variables accesses use an address that consists of a base pointer and an
offset relative to this base pointer. The base pointer address is stored in a special register,
in our case r0. All memory references are therefore of the form MEM(r0 + offset). This
is what the instructions loadI, loadAI, storeAI and outputAI use. All addresses are
byte addresses. Your compiler should assign the address 1024 to r0 at the beginning of the
program. For our example language, variable offsets are non-negative byte addresses. Your
compiler should map variable ‚Äúa‚Äù to offset 0, variable ‚Äúb‚Äù to offset 4, variable ‚Äúc‚Äù to offset
8, etc. Other mappings are also possible, so we are really talking about ‚Äúcode shape‚Äù here,
which is a particular coding style.
Your compiler should generate code that does not ‚Äúreuse‚Äù registers. If you assign a value
to a register by a loadI, loadAI, add, sub, mult or div instruction, you will always use
a fresh, i.e., new register. Your target machine has many registers, so do not worry about
running out of registers. For example, this means that the code generated for +11 will
generate two loadI instructions with two distinct target registers and one add instruction.
This coding style is also called the register-register model, where each computed value gets
its own register. In a real compiler, an additional optimization pass maps (virtual) registers
to the limited number of physical registers of a machine. This step is typically called register
allocation. We do not deal with register allocation here.
Our tinyL language does not contain any control flow constructs (e.g.: jumps, if-thenelse,
while). This means that every generated instruction in the instruction sequence will be
executed.
2 Project Description
The project consists of two main parts:
1. Complete the partially implemented recursive descent LL(1) parser that generates
ILOC instructions.
2. Write a peephole optimizer for constant folding and operator strength reduction.
In addition, you are asked to write the PrintInstructionList routine. The project
represents an entire programming environment consisting of a compiler, an optimizer, and a
simulator (virtual machine) for ILOC. The ILOC simulator is called sim and will be made
available to you as an executable on the ilab machines. This will allow you to check for
correctness of your generated and optimized code.
2.1 Compiler
The recursive descent LL(1) parser implements a simple code generator. You should follow
the main structure of the code as given to you in file Compiler.c. As given to you, the
file contains code for function digit, variable, and partial code for function expr. As is,
3
the compiler is able to generate code only for expressions that contain ‚Äú+‚Äù operations on
operands that are digits or the variable ‚Äúf‚Äù. You will need to add code in the provided stubs
to generate correct RISC machine code for the entire program. Do not change the signatures
of the recursive functions. Note: The left-hand and right-hand occurrences of variables are
treated differently.
2.2 I/O Instruction Utility
Within the Optimizer, a sequence of ILOC instructions is represented as a doubly-linked
list. You are asked to implement the following utility function in file InstrUtils.c.
void PrintInstructionList(FILE *outfile, Instruction *instr);
Function PrintInstructionList traverses the instruction list beginning with instruction
‚Äùinstr‚Äù. The list is written into file ‚Äùoutfile‚Äù. The implementation of this function must be
based on the utility function
void PrintInstruction(FILE *outfile, Instruction *instr);
The implementation of the latter function is provided to you in file InstrUtils.c. This
is also the file that will contain your implementation of PrintInstructionList
2.3 Peephole Optimization
There are two types of peephole optimizations that you will need to implement: constant
folding and operator strength reduction. Peephole optimizations look for particular instruction
subsequences that can be replaced by a more efficient instruction sequence.
The peephole optimizer uses a sliding window of three RISC machine instructions. It
looks for code patterns as described below. If no pattern is detected, the window is moved
one instruction down the list of instructions. In the case of a successful match and code
replacement, the first instruction of the new window is set to the instruction that immediately
follows the instructions that have been replaced, i.e., is set to the instruction immediately
after the pattern in the unoptimized code.
A peephole optimization pass (constfolding or strengthreduct) expects the ILOC input
file to be provided at the standard input (stdin), and will write the generated code back
to standard output (stdout). This allows the specification of multiple passes of the same
optimization or different sequences of optimization passes using the UNIX pipe feature.
For example, to apply optimization constfolding twice, followed by a strengthreduction pass
strengthreduct with file ‚ÄùtinyL.out‚Äù as input, and file ‚Äùoptimized.out‚Äù as output, we would
specify
./constfolding < tinyL.out | ./constfolding | ./strengthreduct > optimized.out
Instructions that are deleted as part of the optimization process have to be explicitly
deallocated using the C free command in order to avoid memory leaks. You will implement
your two peephole optimization passes in file ConstFolding.c and StrengthReduction.c.

2.3.1 Constant folding
Patterns are consecutive instructions in your ILOC program. The pattern for constant
folding is a follows:
loadI c1 ‚áí ra
loadI c2 ‚áí rb
OP ra, rb ‚áí rc
where c1 and c2 are integer constant, and OP is an arithmetic operation (add, sub,
mult). Note: We do not apply this optimization for the division operator. The above
pattern can be replaced by the code sequence
loadI c3 ‚áí rc
where c3 is the integer constant that represents the result of the computation (c1 OP
c2), which is done at compile time. Due to the code shape assumption, register values in
ra and rb are not used after the optimized pattern, allowing the two loadI instructions to
be deleted.
2.3.2 Operator strength reduction
The patterns for this optimization are as follows:
loadI c1 ‚áí ra
OP rb, ra ‚áí rc
where c1 is an integer constant and a power of 2 (e.g.: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...) and OP is the
arithmetic operation mult or div. Multiplication and division can be implemented as leftshift
or right-shift operations, respectively. For example,
loadI 4 ‚áí ra
div rb, ra ‚áí rc
can be replaced by
rshiftI rb, 2 ‚áí rc
and
5
loadI 4 ‚áí ra
mult rb, ra ‚áí rc
can be replaced by
lshiftI rb, 2 ‚áí rc
Note: Arithmetic integer operations may result in overflow or underflow conditions due
to the finite bit-width of the integer representation. However, this is not a problem for these
peephole optimizations since the overflow/underflow would also occur in the unoptimized
code.
2.4 ILOC Simulator
The virtual machine executes ILOC program. If a outputAI <id> instruction is executed,
the value of the specified memory location is written to standard output (stdout). All values
are of type integer. An ILOC simulator is provided as an executable (sim). The ILOC
simulator reports the overall number of executed instructions for a given input program.
This allows you to assess the effectiveness of your dead code elimination optimization. You
also will be able to check for correctness of your optimization pass.
3 Grading
You will submit your versions of files ConstFolding.c, StrengthReduction.c, Compiler.c
and InstrUtils.c. You may also submit an optional ReadMe file if you want to communicate
something about your code to the grader. No other file should be modified, and no
additional file(s) may be used. The electronic submission procedure will be posted later.
Do not submit any executables or any of your test cases.
Your programs will be graded based mainly on functionality. Functionality will be verified
through automatic testing on a set of syntactically correct test cases. No error handing
is required. The original project distribution contains some test cases. Note that during
grading we will use additional test cases not known to you in advance. The distribution also
contains executables of reference solutions for the compiler (compile.sol) and the optimizers
(constfolding.sol, strenghtreduct.sol), and the iloc simulator sim. A simple Makefile is also
provided in the distribution for your convenience. For example, in order to create the
compiler, say make compile at the Linux prompt, which will generate the executable compile.
The provided, initial compiler is able to parse and generate code for very simple programs
consisting of a single assignment statement with right-hand side expresssions of only additions
of numbers, followed by a single print statement. You will need to be able to accept
and compile the full tinyL language.
The Makefile also contains rules to create executables of your optimization passes.

4 How To Get Started
The code for this project lives on the ilab cluster in directory:
www.cs.rutgers.edu/courses/314/classes/fall 2017 kremer/projects/proj1/students
Create your own directory on the ilab cluster, and copy the entire provided project
proj1.tar to your own home directory or any other one of your directories. Say tar -xf
proj1.tar to extract the project files. Make sure that the read, write, and execute permissions
for groups and others are disabled (chmod go-rwx <directory name>). IT IS
CONSIDERED CHEATING IF YOU DO NOT PROTECT YOUR PROJECT
FILES.
Say make compile to generate the compiler. To run the compiler on a test case ‚Äútest‚Äù, say
./compile test. This will generate a RISC machine program in file tinyL.out. To create
an optimization pass, say make constfolding or make strengthreduct. The distributed
versions of the two optimization passes do not work at all, and the compiler can only handle
a single example program structure consisting of a single assignment statement followed by
a print statemet. An example test case that the provided compiler can handle is given in
file tests/test-dummy.
To call your optimization pass constfolding on a file that contains RISC machine code,
for instance file tinyL.out, say ./constfolding < tinyL.out > optimized.out. This
will generate a new file optimized.out containing the output of your optimizer. The operators
‚Äú<‚Äù and ‚Äú>‚Äù are Linux redirection operators for standard input (stdin) and standard
output (stdout), respectively. The same holds for your strenthreduct optimization pass.
You may want to use valgrind for memory leak detection. We recommend to use the
following flags, in this case to test the optimizer for memory leaks:
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes --track-origins=yes ./constfolding
< tinyL.out
To run a program on the ILOC simulator, for instance tinyL.out, say ./sim < tinyL.out.
Finally, you can define a tinyL language interpreter on a single Linux command line as
follows:
./compile test; ./strengthreduct < tinyL.out > opt.out; ./sim < opt.out
The ‚Äú;‚Äù operator allows you to specify a sequence of Linux commands on a single command
line.
